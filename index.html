<p>Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead</p>

<p>I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p></div>

<p>And in your eyes you’re holding mine</p></div>
<div class="verse"><p>Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms</p>
<p>Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song</p>
<p>When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath</p>
<p>But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight</p>

<p>To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>
<p>We are still kids, but we’re so in love, fighting against all odds</p>
<p>I know we’ll be alright this time</p>
<p>Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I’ll be your man</p>
<p>I see my future in your eyes</p></div>

<p>Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song</p>
<p>When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful</p>
<p>I don’t deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight</p></div>
<div class="verse"><p>Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms</p>
<p>Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song</p>

<p>And she looks perfect, I don’t deserve this</p>
<p>You look perfect tonight</p></div>
