<div class="title">Perfect</div>
<div class="text">
  <div class="first">I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</div>
<div class="second">Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you’re holding mine</div>
<div class="third">Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight
</div>
	<div class="fourth">Well I found a woman,stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I’ll share her home
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we’re so in love, fighting against all odds
I know we’ll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I’ll be your man
I see my future in your eyes</div>
