<div class="title">Perfect</div>
<div class="text">
  <div class="first">I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</div>
<div class="second">Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you’re holding mine</div>
<div class="third">Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight
</div>
